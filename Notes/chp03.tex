\section{Problems}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item[P.3.1] Determine the functions $R(n)$ for the reproductive factor in the logistic growth model, such that the shape of the functions is consistent with the first figure above. In each case, choose the parameters such that the intercept is $R(0)=1+r$, and the value when $N=K$ is $R(K)=1$. Specifically, derive
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(a)] A function that declines exponentially to zero.
		\item[(b)] A quadratic function with a maximum at $n=0$.
		\item[(c)] A reverse-S-shaped function that declines from $1+r$ to zero. Keep $a$ arbitrary, and use Rule P1.1 above to increase the intercept to $1+r$. Hint: Start by stretching the generic formula for the S-shaped function along the $y$ axis.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\item[P.3.2] Use Recipe P1.1 to confirm the following linear approximations:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[(a)] $e^r \approx 1 + r$, assuming $r$ is small,
		\item[(b)] $1/(1+s) \approx 1 - s$, assuming $s$ is small,
		\item[(c)] $\ln(t) \approx t - 1$, assuming $t$ is near 1, and
		\item[(d)] $1/x \approx 1/a - 1/(a^2) (x - a)$, assuming $x$ is near $a$.
	\end{enumerate}
